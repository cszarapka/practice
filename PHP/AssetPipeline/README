Demo - PHP Assets Pipelining / Caching
Compress assets into a single file to reduce the number of HTTP request and the size

 - General usage: 
      $AssetsCache->printJS('group_name', $files_array)
      $AssetsCache->printCSS('group_name', $files_array, <media type>)
 - Assets can be grouped with a unique group name
 - Expiry can be set either 'footprint'(automatic) or an integer(seconds)

More..
 - cacheKey and type need to be specified to identify the group of assets
 - Assets need to be store on {$cacheUrl}/{$type}/ (e.g. /assets/js/)
 - Expiry can be set either 'footprint' or an integer(seconds)
     - Footprint method flushes cache if the file is modified, but the average running time can be slow
     - Time method would have faster average running time, but is not refreshed automatically if the files modified
 
 - Known Issues
     - JSMin library is not perfect for every javascript files, thus the output need to be checked
